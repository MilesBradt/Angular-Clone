# Etsy Clone (WIP)
_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5._

## Description
So far this is only a small framework for the homepage of [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) built in Angular

## What this includes
So far this is a none interactive webpage with basic components fitted together

## WIP plans

* Proper communication between components

* Routing to view more information on items and mock cart to checkout

* Actual databases to store mock users and items for the website to work with

* CSS styling

* Proper image edits

## How to get there
Next steps include:
  * Having reviews pull users and item value from their own components rather than copy them

  * Adding extra items and users

  * Add routing to see further item/user details

  * Add search feature to route to item details (might only be exact name of item)

  * Add shop for gifts bar with mock items

  * Create database for mock items and users, translate to work with website

  * Possible other ideas as they come

  * CSS styling and image editing

## How to run

* Type "npm install" and wait for that to finish

* Type "ng serve" and wait for the webpage to compile

* Go to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser
