# Speedrun Guides (WIP)
_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5._

## Description
So far this is only a small framework for Speedrun Guides, the plan is to have users in communities build guides for learning new speedruns on an easy to use site with easy to follow instructions all in one place

## What this includes
So far this is a framework of seeing a game list on a homepage and not even bare minimum of game details

## WIP plans

* Proper naming of elements

* Database with user input

* Expand on game details: average run length, user vote on difficulty, link to leaderboards, etc.

* Tabs per category for games, places to display guides and iframes for links to videos

* Display route (for speedruns) layout with options to link to videos

* CSS styling

* Proper image edits

## How to run

* Type "npm install" and wait for that to finish

* Type "ng serve" and wait for the webpage to compile

* Go to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser
